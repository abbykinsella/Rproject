################# main script that calls all the functions in supportingFunctions.R   ########################


###### FUNCTION CONVERT CALL ##########
# function that converts tab or space delimeted text files to comma delimited csv files
#   ***countryX is already in csv form so this step is not necessary
convert_csv("countryY")


###### FUNCTION COMPILE CALL ##########
# function that compiles ALL csv files into a SINGLE csv file
# same 12 columns as original and countryX/Y and day of year in new columns

### mini function user input ###
# user options
# 1. remove rows with NAs in any column
# 2. include NAs but be warned of their presence
# 3. include NAs but don't be warned

# call compile function with choice
# clear any previous compilations
if (file.exists("all.csv")) {
  unlink("all.csv")
}
x_df <- compile("countryX", 2)
y_df <- compile("countryY", 2)
combined <- rbind(x_df, y_df)
write.csv(combined, "all.csv", row.names = FALSE)



###### FUNCTION SUMMARIZE CALL ##########
file <- read.csv("allData.csv")   # provided data, we can test with our file too 
infected <- summarize(file) # this function takes a minute or two to run 
write.csv(infected, "infected.csv", row.names = FALSE)

###### Question 1 ##########
infected_patients <- read.csv("infected.csv")
ggplot(infected_patients, aes(x=dayofYear, fill=country)) + geom_bar(position="dodge")
# The outbreak most likely started in countryX since the first infection occurred in countryX.
# Further, there were way more cases in countryX, especially within the first 20 days of the outbreak

####### Question 2 #########
ggplot(infected_patients, aes(x=marker, fill=country)) + geom_bar(position="dodge")
# A vaccine developed for the patients of country X would most likely not work for country Y.  This is
# because the markers shown in patients from country X are mainly 1-5, while the markers shown in patients
# from country Y are mostly 6-10. A vaccine for country X would elicit an immune response for the 1-5 markers
# and would not help protect the patients from country Y, and vice versa.
